# Atomic Sales Dashboard (Next.js 15 + TypeScript + Tailwind + Recharts)

A minimal, **atomic design**-structured dashboard that visualizes sales for **2022–2024**.

- 2022 & 2023 are computed from the provided CSV dataset (`amazon_sales_dataset.csv`).
- **2024 is synthetic** (generated by applying +5% growth on 2023 monthly/category totals) so you have a full three-year view.

## What I built

- **Atomic structure**: `atoms/`, `molecules/`, `organisms/`, and a `DashboardTemplate`.
- **Dashboard page** (`/dashboard`) with:
  - Year switcher (2022/2023/2024)
  - **Custom sales threshold** input to exclude low-value orders
  - **Multiple chart types** using Recharts (Bar, Line, Pie)
  - KPI cards (total revenue, orders, AOV)
- **API route** (`/api/sales`) that parses the CSV on the server, aggregates data by year/month/category, and returns JSON. This makes swapping in a real API trivial later.
- **Tailwind** styling and clean, accessible UI.

## Project structure

```
app/
  api/sales/route.ts     # API integration (server)
  dashboard/page.tsx     # Dashboard page (client)
  layout.tsx, page.tsx
public/data/amazon_sales_dataset.csv
src/
  components/
    atoms/               # Button, Card, Heading, Input
    molecules/           # YearPicker, ThresholdInput, ChartTypeToggle, KPIStat
    organisms/           # SalesChart (Bar/Line), SalesPie, KPI row
  templates/DashboardTemplate.tsx
```

## Getting started

> Requirements: Node.js 18+ and npm (or pnpm/yarn)

```bash
# 1) Install deps
npm install

# 2) Run dev server
npm run dev
# Visit http://localhost:3000
```

## Using your own/real API later

Replace `app/api/sales/route.ts` with a fetch to your backend or a public data API. Keep the returned shape:

```ts
{
  year: number,
  monthly: { month: string; revenue: number }[],
  byCategory: { name: string; value: number }[],
  totals: { revenue: number; orders: number; avgOrderValue: number }
}
```

## GitHub – create a repo and push

```bash
# From project root
git init
git add .
git commit -m "feat: initial atomic sales dashboard"
# Create a new GitHub repo in your account, then:
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/atomic-sales-dashboard.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Notes

- The **2024** figures are **mocked** for demonstration (5% uplift on 2023). Update logic in `app/api/sales/route.ts` to change the growth rule or replace with real data.
- Threshold filter applies when computing aggregates on the server.
- Recharts is used for Bar, Line, Pie; you can easily add Area or Radar charts.
